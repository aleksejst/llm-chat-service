Package Management:
- Use `uv` instead of pip for all Python package installations
- In Dockerfiles: install uv first, then use `uv pip install` or `uv sync`
- Never use bare `pip install` commands
- Reason: uv is 10-100x faster than pip and handles dependency resolution better

Docker Best Practices:
- Install uv in Dockerfile before installing packages
- Use uv's caching for faster rebuilds
- Example pattern:
  RUN pip install uv
  RUN uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt
