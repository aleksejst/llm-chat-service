Dependency Management:
- Always use latest stable versions unless there's a known incompatibility
- Pin exact versions with ==
- Test that versions work together before committing
- Update Gradio to 5.x series (4.x is outdated)
- Keep huggingface_hub at 0.26.x for Gradio 5.x compatibility
- Document any specific version constraints with inline comments
